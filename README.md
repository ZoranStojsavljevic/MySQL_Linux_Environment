### MySQL Linux Environment

A bit about SQL native "language". SQL "language" is not a true
programming language, rather a set of the rules formulated as a
kind of a script.

This repo attemts to solve some pitfalls with MySQL server Fedora
setup (as a representative of a MySQL general Linux distros) and
some MySQL clients' setups as well.

There are also some clients' examples presented in this repo.

I installed the native MySQL client called PopSQL. Also I will
try to install and use another MySQL client based on Python3's
connector using pip (phyton installer program) as an installer.

What is a pip? A package-management system written in Python and
it is used to install and manage software packages. The Python
Software Foundation recommends using pip for installing Python
applications and its dependencies during deployment.

I hope this repo will help to the MySQL beginners (as it helps
me as a general vague documentation).

To start MySQL course for the beginners/novices, please, watch
the following video (an excellent MySQL course from Mike Dane):
