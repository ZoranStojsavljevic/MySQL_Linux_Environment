### MySQL Python Client Examples

Shows some excerpts from Brad's MySQL Python Client course:

* [Python & MySQL Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHwgnGEhYG8&t)

The full examples presented/shown by Brad are here (I do my
own formats/interpretations to better understand the code):

* [Brad' MySQL Phyton Client example](https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/5ea2fa59776ddc8cf45c536be65d4f86)

I did modify this code to intro a bit more compexity, just to
get an idea what I am facing. The code needs to be polished,
so this is NOT a final version of the code in: python_mysql.py
example. Also, I might add other examples.

Please, do note that I did NOT use any MySQL Python Client IDE,
rather using normal Python shell. As for now prefering a Python
Client minimal environment.

I potentially might introduce Python Client IDE for Fedora
(later). Maybe/if?
